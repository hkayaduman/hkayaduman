# üëã Hi, I'm Dr. Halil Kayaduman

I am an Associate Professor at the Distance Education Application and Research Center at Inonu University, Turkey. I recently worked as a Visiting Postdoctoral Researcher at the School of Computing, University of Eastern Finland. During this time, I applied advanced analytical and modeling methods, including **sequence analysis, clustering, process mining, psychological networks, transition network analysis, VaSSTra, and multilevel vector autoregression.**

I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Education and Instructional Technology from Middle East Technical University, Turkey, and spent a year as a visiting research scholar at the University of Florida, USA. After completing my Ph.D., I served as an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Igdir University, Turkey, where I taught courses in instructional design, basic statistics, human-computer interaction, and computer programming. I also held administrative roles as Director of the Digital Education Coordinatorship and Deputy Director of the Distance Education Application and Research Center at Igdir University.

In addition to my academic work, I design and build AI agents and workflow automations using n8n, integrating intelligent systems into real-world applications.

My research interests include AI in Education, Educational Technology, Human-centered AI, Learning Analytics, Human‚ÄìComputer Interaction (HCI), and Open and Distance Education.
